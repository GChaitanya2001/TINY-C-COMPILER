# TINY-C-COMPILER

* Implemented as a part of Compilers course project at IIT Kharagpur
* This project follows the phase structure grammar specification of C language from the International Standard ISO/IEC 9899:1999 (E). To keep it within required scope, we have chosen a subset of the specification. We shall refer to this language as tinyC.
* The lexical specification of tinyC, also taken and abridged from the Standard. The phase structure grammar specification is written using the common notation of language specifications.
